# ASP.NET Core: Faster Api with Multi-Layer cache!

Speaking of caching, you may already have an in-memory or Distributed cache (like Redis) in your application but both approaches have some issues.

In-memory cache can't be used when you have distributed systems and multiple instances of your API, since it's memory-specific.
Distributed cache has the issue of I/O operation and network latency.

Can we merge both approaches? Yes for sure!

In this repo, I've tried to show how to implement a multi-layer cache in ASP.NET Core.
